# SiteSurvey Pro – ISP Site Survey Management System

SiteSurvey Pro is a full-stack web application designed to simplify and digitize the **site survey process for Internet Service Providers (ISPs)**.  
The system helps surveyors and administrators manage **properties, buildings, floors, spaces, and checklists** efficiently within large environments such as **college campuses**.

This project focuses on real-world use cases like surveying **classrooms, laboratories, staff rooms, corridors, libraries, hostels, and server rooms** for network planning and deployment.
